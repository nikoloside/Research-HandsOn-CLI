# DeepDockerTools

The purpose of the tools

- We need a tool for automatically process multi-environment.
    - We need install python environment
        - python with right version
        - pip & library setting with right version
        - Third Party Library Set-up & Compiling
    - We need process python Lib setting in multi-platform
        - Local Ubuntu Pc for testing
        - Remote GSM for running PoC
        - Remote Cloud for generate Main Data

## Function Lists
We need a set-up tool for new graduate student to process Deep program easily.
- CLI tools for one-click set-up docker
- CLI tools for run test code both on local & private cloud & remote cloud
- CLI tools for the other extensive function of research support
- CLI tools for research graph output, from research PoC to paper's data gathering.
- CLI tools for preventing reproduce code for wasting person's time.
- Database for collecting the background of Research Field.
- Database for collecting the Learning Path.
- A guidance for new graduate of how we start to do research.

## Motivation
We try to describe the motivation of the library.
To help the university new graduate maintenance the code. (Or create new code for )

    - try to make the new graduate student focus on the method of deep algorithm
    - try to make the new graduate get used of research core part quickly.
    - try to make the new graduate without thinking about the old code legacy.
    - try to make the new graduate without wasting the time to learn the things and code outside the research
