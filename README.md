# Kanai Lab Research CLI

## Focus

Research need a lot of engineering & code base knowledge & legacy issues and troubleshooting.

- We need a guidance for new graduate student to start up.
- We need a legacy stable code base for new graduate student.
  - preventing from reproducing research tools.
  - have a stable and reliable tool-set without debug time.
- We need a Meeting to discuss the research background and save the document for helping catching-up.
  - Meeting in Thursday evening
    - Sharing the blocker issues and share our solution
    - Share the research background to understand the context of the research.
  - A loading page for PR, knowledge database, event database
  - A wechat group for communication
  - A github to save the tools and knowledge
    - Slider of research context
    - Paper reading of Siggraph and Eurograph and Lab-introduction
    - Guidance to Everything we need to know
    - Code for open-source tool list

**Be careful about the research lab compliance**
